# Leveraging Modern Vision Model Architectures and Transfer Learning for Accurate Medical Image Analysis

## Overview
This research project explores the application of **modern vision model architectures** and **transfer learning** for accurate medical image analysis.

We utilize **DenseNet, ResNet, ConvNeXt, ViT**, pretrained on **ImageNet**, and fine-tune them on smaller medical image datasets to evaluate their effectiveness.

## Model Architectures
The models used in this research:
- **DenseNet201** (~20M parameters)
- **ResNet50** (~25M parameters)
- **EfficientNet-B4**
- **ConvNeXt-T** (~29M parameters)
- **ViT-S** (~22M parameters)

## Datasets
Three medical image datasets are used:
1. **COVID Dataset**: 2.5k images, 2 classes
2. **BreaKHis Dataset**: 1.5k images, 2 classes
3. **Brain Tumor Dataset**: 7k images, 4 classes
